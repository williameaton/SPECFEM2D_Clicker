    "## Creating a cartesian mesh with sinusoidal boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "Author: W Eaton (weaton@princeton.edu) \\\n",
    "Last updated: 23/05/2022\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites/dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "We will need to have the following installed: \n",
    "* SPECFEM2D  - [available here on Github](https://github.com/SPECFEM/specfem2d)\n",
    "* MeshAssist - [available here on Github](https://github.com/homnath/MeshAssist)\n",
    "* Cubit      - You can get a free academic (trial license) from [their website](https://coreform.com/products/coreform-cubit/free-meshing-software/)\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cubit trial version allows you to generate small-to-medium sized meshes. For 3D it is limited to 50,000 hexahedra. I'm not sure what it is for 2D. Of course, each of these packages have a number of their own dependencies. See their own respective manuals for installation. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some Cubit basics\n",
    "\n",
    "Cubit has a GUI for interactive mesh building, but is fundamentally driven by python code. There are (annoyingly) some minor differences between Cubit Python and normal Python - there are some notes on this in the [Mesh Generation](https://specfem2d.readthedocs.io/en/latest/03_mesh_generation/) section of the manual, but it wont affect us much. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Cubit has an object-oriented structure. Objects include: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Vertices - individual points \n",
    "* Curves   - made up of points\n",
    "* Surfaces - defined by bounding curves\n",
    "* Volumes  - defined by bounding surfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "For using SPECFEM2D we will only need to worry about vertices, curves, and surfaces.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When you first open CUBIT, the screen will look something like this: \n",
    "![blank_cubit](./notebook_figs/cubit_blank.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The left Panel 'Model Tree' shows you a tree-structure of the different objects you have created. Below this the 'Properties Page' lists properties of a selected object - more on this later. On the right, the 'Command Panel' is the main GUI for creating and modifying objects. Finally, the bottom terminal allows you to enter Python/Cubit commands. The history tab is also useful for keeping a copy of all the command you have previously entered. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For creating objects you have two options: \n",
    "* Use the GUI Command Panel\n",
    "* Enter commands directly\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For experimenting, the GUI is very useful - but you dont want to have to use it for creating 100 vertices individiually! In this case, it is easier to generate commands somehow, and then copy-paste them into the terminal. This is what we will do below. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Making our mesh: \n",
    "Lets start by defining some dimensions. We will create a box with an internal, sinusoidal surface. "
